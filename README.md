# ICIP4-High-Resolution-Class-Activation-Mapping
This project repository contains the code files of a group project (ICIP4) for the Jacobs University Data Engineering class: Data Visualization and Image Processing.

The general structure of this sofware (code files) originally belongs to the paper "High Resolution Class Activation Mapping for Discriminative Feature Localization" by Thanos Tagaris, Maria Sdraka and Andreas Stafylopatis and their paper repository link is: https://github.com/djib2011/high-res-mapping.git

As the project group, we have generated our own code file and integrate it to the above mentioned software to be able to have outputs. That is the reason we keep all the original work code files in our repository. The manual explains how to use this repository code files was uploaded in Moodle course page.
